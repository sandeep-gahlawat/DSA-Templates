// Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends.



// Time Complexity
// push_front()=> Inserts the element at the beginning  => O(1)

// push_back() =>Adds element at the end. => O(1)

// pop_front() => Removes the first element from the deque.=>O(1)


// pop_back()=>Removes the last element from the deque.=>O(1)

// front()	Gets the front element from the deque.	=>O(1)

// back()	Gets the last element from the deque.	=>O(1)

// empty()	Checks whether the deque is empty or not.	=>O(1)

// size()	Determines the number of elements in the deque.	=>O(1)

// clear(): Remove all the elements from the deque. It leaves the deque with a size of 0.


// e.g problems
// For example see the Maximum of all subarrays of size k problem., 0-1 BFS, and Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps.
