// An AVL tree defined as a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.

// The difference between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree for any node is known as the balance factor of the node.

// Applications of AVL Tree:
// It is used to index huge records in a database and also to efficiently search in that.
// For all types of in-memory collections, including sets and dictionaries, AVL Trees are used.
// Database applications, where insertions and deletions are less common but frequent data lookups are necessary
// Software that needs optimized search.
// It is applied in corporate areas and storyline games.


// Advantages of AVL Tree:
// AVL trees can self-balance themselves.
// It is surely not skewed.
// It provides faster lookups than Red-Black Trees
// Better searching time complexity compared to other trees like binary tree.
// Height cannot exceed log(N), where, N is the total number of nodes in the tree.


// Disadvantages of AVL Tree:
// It is difficult to implement.
// It has high constant factors for some of the operations.
// Less used compared to Red-Black trees.
// Due to its rather strict balance, AVL trees provide complicated insertion and removal operations as more rotations are performed.
// Take more processing for balancing.
