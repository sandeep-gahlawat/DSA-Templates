// 1  a^b = c  => a^c = b,b^c=a it is very helpful in cases like prefix sum of xores 
//   also it is used in swapping two numbers

//  (a&b)^(a&c)^(a&d)^(a&e)---=>it is equal to a&(b^c^d^e-----);it is very helpful result

// (odd number)^(odd number) = even number
// (odd number)^(even number) = odd number
