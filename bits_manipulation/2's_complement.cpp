// Example-1 − Find 2’s complement of binary number 10101110.

// Simply invert each bit of given binary number, which will be 01010001. Then add 1 to the LSB of this result, i.e., 01010001+1=01010010 which is answer.

// Example-2 − Find 2’s complement of binary number 10001.001.

// Simply invert each bit of given binary number, which will be 01110.110 Then add 1 to the LSB of this result, i.e., 01110.110+1=01110.111 which is answer.

// Example-3 − Find 2’s complement of each 3 bit binary number.

// Simply invert each bit of given binary number, then add 1 to LSB of these inverted numbers,
